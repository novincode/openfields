## 💡 Quick Example

The API is simple and familiar if you've used ACF:

```php
// Get a single field value
$product_price = get_field('price', get_the_ID());
echo 'Price: $' . $product_price;

// Get all fields in a fieldset
$product = get_field('product_details', get_the_ID(), false);
// Returns array of all fields in that fieldset

// Repeater fields
if (have_rows('team_members')) {
    while (have_rows('team_members')) {
        the_row();
        echo get_sub_field('name');
    }
}
```

That's it! The API is intuitive and requires no special syntax.
